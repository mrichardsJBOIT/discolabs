# Cover Letter For Disco Labs

---
## Hello
Dear Disco Labs,  
Mark here,  I hope you're well?  I also hope my copy writing skills are not as important as my technical and business skills?
### Quick Brown Fox
This challenge seems quite fun and an interesting and reminds me of a challenge to get all letters of the alphabet into a paragraph, which can be done using the sentence  

> the quick brown fix jumps over the lazy dog
### About Me
Well, I enjoy technical challenges, I have worked a lot for retail, wholesale and FMCG type organisations.  Outside of work I play golf and am focusing on general fitness so I can get back into surfing.
### Why Disco Labs?
Given that I like working in IT and I'd like to use my existing experience and learn new skills, Disco Labs seems to be the organisation to do that.  A quality technology company that provides services and products to business.  
I enjoy coding, having recently lead a Rail SaaS integration on an existing platform, I realised I'd like to grow further in the space and move to a software house that does things in a quality fashion and strives for technical excellence.  As Jason Fried writes, it doesn't have to be crazy at work. 
### Technical Artefacts
I will create a non production script to calculate my **DISCO SCORE**.  Which you can find at [my GitHub Disco Labs Repo](https://github.com/mrichardsJBOIT/discolabs.git)
### Thank You
While this cover letter is brief, I hope it is enough for you to invite me to a formal interview.  Thank you for the opportunity to attempt this.  
  
Mark
